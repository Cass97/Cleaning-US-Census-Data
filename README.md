# Cleaning-US-Census-Data
Informal Q&amp;A project as part of Codecademy Data Wrangling, Cleaning and Tidying modules
This was an off-platform project as part of the "Clean Data with Python" module in the Codecademy Data Science course. It was used for practical learning of data wrangling using the Python Pandas library. It demonstrates the use of Regex, string parsing and indexing, dropping duplicates and other Pandas functions. This is intended to be a record of my learning only and not judged as a formal assessment.
